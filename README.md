## Payco Coding Challenge

Please read the instructions carefully. 

This is an empty [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 

You will use this project for your coding challenge, so please clone this repository to your machine. 

Your machine should already have NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (NPM) installed.

Your task is to convert a Figma UI design into a HTML page, using a web component library developed by Amazon called [Cloudscape Design System (CDS)](https://cloudscape.design/components/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and open the terminal or your IDE in the repository root.

Second, install the dependencies using the node package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

Third, run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The empty project has the example code from [this page in the CDS documentation](https://cloudscape.design/get-started/integration/using-cloudscape-components/).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates in the browser as you edit and save the file.

## Submission

The only file you need to submit is `pages/index.js`, so please do not modify any other file.

Please send the completed Javascript file to a member of the Payco team by email.
